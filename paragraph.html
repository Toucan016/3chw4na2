    Happy birthday Bhavana I would like to say, first of all. This is probably going to be the only place where I refer you as "Bhavana".
    A cute name nevertheless. I remember how it all really started, because of the dumb rizz line I saw from youtube.
    I first thought it was just going to be some normal online friendship. But boy I was very wrong. I geniunely wanted to write a paragraph over you and a bit on myself, the change.
    This was the least I could do for a birthday gift. I never gifted any online friend or I have went to anyones birthday party since 2016 I believe.
    Nor I ever had recieved any gifts or had anyone on my birthday party. I hope this makes you happy cause this is all I can do.
    Probably a little too dissapointing over all the hype you had. I would like to apologize for that. I'm sorry. I made this from love, I hope you like it.
    <br><br>
    I can never thank you enough, the man you made. I'm glad meeting you. Before I met you, a week or so before things were not looking good for me, then I met you.
    But whenever I talked to you, I felt a sense of comfort and kindness which made me feel better. You are probably thinking you didn't do anything.
    Trust me you did everything and I mean everything. Whenever around you it felt like there was nothing to worry about anything anymore.
    Whenever I talked to you no matter how bad my day might be going, you'll always light it up, even at my worst.
    You made me realize so many things and helped me so much I can never return it. You helped a man who has nothing to give in return.
    Your name is perfect for who you are. "Bhavana" or feelings. You are the only person I text the most throughout the day.
    You are the first person I text in the morning and the last at night. You are deserving more than what you think you deserve.
    My life completely changed all because of you and for the betterment. You always listened to me no matter what it is.
    For all the games of call of duty we would play it always made me forget of the problems I had.
    I geniunely lack the words to even describe the beauty you have. You cared when no one did. I will sit there and smile whenever I thought of this topic.
    Even though I'm going through severe health related problems, I am trying to find the solution to it. I want to live. I dont want to be dead as the only child I am.
    I am not really there in your life to give you a hug or something worth more gifting than this. You are the kindest soul I've ever met.
    I'm very glad to have someone like you in my life. You are very precious to me nonetheless. I hope the wishes you make come true.
    Everything would just be fine at the end of the day. I always felt calm talking to you like you were just sitting right beside me.
    I always felt something different whenever I talked to you but it was always a very positive feeling surrounding me. I couldn't explain.
    The piece that was missing from myself was you, I failed to realize it even though I had found one more piece of the puzzle in my heart and you helped me even more to put it together.
    I sought out to be better than anyone else but now I have no reason to fight. I just want to be better than yesterday.
    The biggest mistake I ever made was to expect something in return of being kind. The day I stopped expecting was when I saw the gift, being kind is the reason itself.
    You are very strong, remember when I said the first thing I'll do if I see you in real life was to hug the hell out of you, you'll probably hug me so hard it would break my bones lol. I won't be mad though.
    You helped me to find my purpose in life, till then I was just only existing but now I am living. I have a purpose and all thanks to you.
    Even these huge paragraphs will never be able to describe the greatness you have in yourself. I am just a normal person, I am not special or anything but trust me you are really special, to me atleast.
    I really want to meet you one day. 2023 was an amazing year, things did started getting better and better, and I hope for you too! Mostly because you came into my life.
    Make sure you make your parents proud, it can be hard but theres always a way out. Just like math, I know this is very stupid of me bringing math into here.
    Every question I could not solve taught me how to be patient knowing theres a solution I am missing. I always kept myself calm and patient and my dad always told me if I cannot solve it I should leave it for a while and come back to it later.
    It would always work, sometimes you'll get so jumbled and lost into a forest of trying to find a way out that even if its infront of you, you would not be able to notice it.
    Just like how I was trying to find the piece that was missing, I really got jumbled and when I thought about it later I knew the answer. It was you as I wrote above. I hate seeing you being stressed, dont be stressed.
    <br>
    <br>
    A few more things I want to state here before I finish writing this is, set a dream, be delusional about it and try achieveing it, I know you can do it.
    I believe in you remember that so do your parents and the god who is always watching us isn't it. I hope this bond between us lasts eternal, for the person you are.
    You are truly one of the greatest I've ever met. I can go writing pages and pages millions and trillions forget the count and I would still lack to describe you.
    I wanted to keep the things I wrote here simple, sometimes I just love the simple language.
    I want to see you have a great life ahead for you. I could not wake up till 12 a.m to wish you so I would like to be sorry for that because I would end up being sick. I am sorry, I hope you understand.
    You changed a person in 3 months that no one could in 3 years. I will remain indebted to you.
    I hope you enjoy the birthday with your loved ones. 16 years is a long time, as a child you probably never thought you will make it this far, crazy honestly.
    Maintain the health you have as well as mental health dont get caught up like I did which led to me to the things I am suffering from today, you are so strong like I want to take a moment to appreciate that.
    Nevertheless I like travelling alot as you know and meeting you in real life is on my bucket list. I apologize for the mistakes I made or I did some things you didn't like. Forgive me for that.
    Also never loose hope as you are made of faith, keep faith in yourself. Look, if you are lost or feeling down just know I am there to listen it all no matter how long it is and provide a solution to it.
    I would wake up till late night waiting for your text. You make my entire day and you deserve it too. Smile alot more, it makes me happy too seeing you happy. You always heard my stupidity and everything. I am very thankful.
    Help is the bravest thing to do, its like refusing to give up, you've probably heard that quote right. Never feel weak to ask help, asking for help does not make you look weak instead shows the determination to do something inside you.
    Be the right person even though you already are! I need to become the right person myself. I hope this beautiful bond between us lasts eternal, and I hope you enjoy your birthday.
    <br>
